00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,550
Hello, I am Siyoung Oh from the
PyCon Korea Organizing Team

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,810
And I am Aven Oh

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,470
This year, there is a special session
from the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,670
We will tell you how we are shaping PyCon
Korea to contribute to the Python ecosystem

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,870
Today, we will talk about about the CoC,
which is PyCon Korea's code of conduct

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,930
Aven, have you heard of the CoC?

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,380
Yes, I have heard of it

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,560
I am sure you are all
observing to the CoC as well

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,760
The CoC is our promise to
everyone participating in PyCon Korea

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,470
PyCon Korea is a community event

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,430
Presenters have stepped up
to share their experiences

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,390
Sponsors, individual sponsors,
business partners,

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,840
and all participants including the
PyCon Korea Organizing Team

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,640
who are volunteering the entire year

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,060
are voluntarily contributing to the
community, expecting nothing in return

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,990
PyCon Korea aims to be an event
in which anyone can easily participate

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,420
We aim to create an atmosphere in which
we acknowledge and respect our differences

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,250
We encourage a welcoming atmosphere

19
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,370
Such values of PyCon Korea
are embodied in this CoC

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,310
To create a Python community
where nobody is excluded

21
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,560
PyCon Korea's CoC is a promise that should
be kept by the members at the very least

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,760
All of you, including myself and
 Aven here, are keeping this promise

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,390
It is kept not just for
the day of the event

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,630
but also while preparing for PyCon Korea
and in all of our contents

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,520
This is how it is done

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,280
Have you imagined an event
where anyone can be involved?

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,590
At PyCon Korea, we want all of you
to be respected for who you are

28
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:10,270
Are you thinking, "Is that even possible?"
or "That's being too idealistic"?

29
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,980
You could think that way

30
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,260
We may not be perfect, but we
are trying and putting in our efforts

31
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,270
while imagining the future
that our efforts will bring

32
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,890
A place where you can feel safe
and have fun talking even with strangers

33
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,100
about Python, which we all have in common

34
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,200
"Sure, this is good enough",
"Everyone's like that"

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,990
"I should keep it in" "Am I sensitive?"
Instead of these thoughts

36
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,550
what about a place where you can point out

37
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,570
that something's wrong
without feeling threatened?

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,480
A community where I am
respected for who I am

39
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,580
and where everyone feels safe
and can trust each other

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,150
A place where we can
all talk about going forward

41
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,190
That's the kind of environment
we are imagining

42
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,610
But Aven,
this is a technology conference

43
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,270
People might wonder why
we are talking so idealistically

44
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,190
Why is it important that we
embrace every participant?

45
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,650
You're right,
and as Siyoung pointed out

46
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,870
this is a technology conference

47
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,990
However, if you ask us why it is so
important that we embrace every participant

48
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,390
this is how we look at it

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,710
I think PyCon Korea's attitude
of respecting diversity

50
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,280
is the source that enriches
our society and community

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,880
Finding a solution to a problem
and keeping the community growing

52
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,350
in order to change the world for the better

53
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,900
requires diverse experience and perspective

54
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,470
Such diverse experience and perspective

55
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,600
begin from respecting and
embracing each other

56
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,440
That's what we think

57
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,550
The CoC is a promise for everyone

58
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,230
The CoC is always evolving
to create a better community

59
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,010
It wasn't made to criticize
or exclude anyone

60
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,050
It also isn't a perfect set of rules
to determine if someone's wrong

61
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,660
That's right, as Siyoung just said

62
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,190
the CoC isn't a set of rules to
criticize or exclude someone

63
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,880
nor is it perfect

64
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,840
However, we are trying things one at a time

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,270
so that our efforts seep through everywhere

66
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,510
One of them is the CoC Agreement
like the one you see below

67
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,820
At PyCon Korea, when presenters
make their presentations

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,380
or when our business partners work with us

69
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,270
or when our sponsors support us

70
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,230
or when someone becomes a member
of the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,230
we sign an agreement like
the one you see below

72
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,080
We also observe the CoC for presentations

73
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,160
When making presentation proposals or
reviewing videos of presentation materials

74
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,060
we check to see if the CoC
has been observed

75
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,970
Although it is unfortunate
we can't see them this year

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,160
you can easily find signs on the CoC
at the offline site of our event

77
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,950
This is how we're creating
an environment where

78
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,260
thoughts are respected
for being different, not wrong

79
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,550
During breaks in between sessions,
we play the CoC guideline video

80
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,590
The CoC guideline video will be played
in between sessions this year as well

81
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,630
so please take a look at it

82
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,750
We are also promoting the CoC
on our official social media account

83
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,030
Also, by slightly applying
the Universal Design

84
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,030
we are preparing financial support
and a barrier-free location for the event

85
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,150
We still have a long way to go

86
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,950
but we are expanding one step at at time

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,880
Also, we educated our PyCon Korea
Organizing Team on disability awareness

88
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,910
We invited specialists and asked a lot
of questions during the session

89
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,890
to raise disability awareness

90
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,250
We provide real-time captions

91
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,960
and subtitles for all videos
shown at PyCon Korea 2020

92
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,830
We aren't perfect

93
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,440
That's why we completely
revised the CoC in 2019

94
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,780
Before its revision, the entire PyCon Korea
Organizing Team held a human rights workshop

95
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,510
and to revise the CoC

96
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,070
we held a 2-day camp dedicated to discuss
the CoC and also held regular debates

97
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,310
It took about 4 months

98
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,270
Before distributing the revised CoC,
we received outside consultation

99
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,390
and even legal consultation before
adding it to our agreement

100
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,670
Also, in 2020, we revised the CoC so that
it can be applied to online environments

101
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,310
Every year, before the event

102
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,270
we hold an internal workshop to
refresh our knowledge on the CoC

103
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,230
Please give us suggestions
on how to improve the CoC

104
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,750
We want to build it together

105
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,390
If you run into a problem,
please report it to us

106
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,710
It will help us to make a safer environment

107
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,590
Did you know about this?

108
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,840
The PyCon Korea Organizing Team
members are also

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,950
ordinary participants as well as volunteers

110
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,510
Aven, when you found out that
the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

111
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,510
are volunteers who purchase tickets,
what did you think?

112
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,510
I thought it was interesting

113
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,190
When I first became a member
of the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

114
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,110
it felt like it was the host of the event

115
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,510
Usually, the host of the event
doesn't purchase separate tickets

116
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,730
But now, I know about 'Everybody Pays'

117
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,670
and that the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

118
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,910
are also ordinary participants
who are contributing in a different way

119
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,960
How about you?

120
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,300
As Aven said,
the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

121
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,060
are volunteers who are
contributing in a different way

122
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,010
just like how you haven't
merely purchased a ticket

123
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:21,230
but contributing to the community
just by participating in this event

124
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,880
Actually, the majority of
the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

125
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,900
consisted of people with jobs or students

126
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,910
So the members would get out
of work and work at night

127
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,190
and sometimes even until dawn,
during lunch hours, and on weekends

128
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,430
to prepare for this event

129
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,310
About fifteen people or so
gathered to plan this event

130
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,320
and we had to talk with so many people

131
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,550
that we were burned out
both physically and mentally

132
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,530
So when we communicated externally

133
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,790
we also sent out the message to
respect the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
since we are participants who
deserve to be respected as well

135
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,740
We are also putting in efforts to
respect each other among ourselves

136
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,230
When we run into a problem,
we don't focus on who's responsible for it

137
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,950
but instead on
how we'll solve the problem

138
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,110
We make decisions and
take responsibility together

139
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,500
The PyCon Korea CoC wasn't created
so that an individual or a minority

140
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,390
can give a good talk

141
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,590
We made it for us

142
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,470
Through PyCon Korea, we hope that
you support each other's experiences

143
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,330
and have a lot of conversations
while being respected

144
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,540
We hope that you grow
deeper, broader, and stronger

145
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,100
and spread a positive influence
to other places as well

146
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,940
We hope that through
this year's PyCon Korea

147
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,590
your world will become a step broader

148
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,060
Thank you

149
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,660
Wait!
Did you think this was the end?

150
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,340
We conducted a short interview on how

151
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,180
the PyCon Korea Organizing Team views the CoC

152
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,520
What is your take on the CoC?

153
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,750
Let's take a look!

154
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,520
My thoughts on the CoC?

155
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,680
At PyCon Korea, the Code of Conduct
is a very challenging subject

156
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,120
PyCon Korea hopes that
more people will use Python

157
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,020
in their daily lives and
at work in various ways

158
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,920
That's why we want to embrace
people from various fields

159
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,900
By participating in the process of creating
and revising the Code of Conduct

160
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,260
I've learned that there are diverse
people and lives in this world

161
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,220
and to embrace everyone, it requires
a lot of deep thinking and effort

162
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,320
Of course, my efforts as an individual
may be small and insignificant

163
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,940
and I am also probably violating the CoC

164
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,770
However, someone here is making an effort

165
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,830
and there are probably people
who know about that

166
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,420
That's why I, or we, hope that

167
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,600
we read the CoC and think about it
even more and take action

168
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,320
My thoughts on the CoC?

169
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,410
I think the CoC is a promise among
the participants to enjoy

170
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,880
a PyCon event that is safe and
where everyone is respected

171
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,020
When I first encountered the CoC,
I was surprised to see that this was dealt

172
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,260
at a developer conference

173
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,010
It's been about four years now,
and it feels strange without it

174
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,010
Outside of PyCon Korea, other developer
conferences are creating codes of conduct

175
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,440
which the participants observe

176
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,970
and the developer community is
becoming safer and more comfortable

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,320
PyCon Korea wasn't the first to do this

178
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,830
but I think it played a role in publicizing

179
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,000
the code of conduct in Korea

180
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,570
I hope there will be more events
in which anyone can easily participate

181
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,900
Thank you

182
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,790
Creating a CoC is a very
difficult task in itself

183
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,640
but I think it is a set of manners selected
from what's normative and ethical

184
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,100
that should be observed at the very least

185
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:05,270
Also, you could say that
the CoC is a measure

186
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,880
to allow contribution in creating a culture

187
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,360
where everyone is equal

188
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,480
If there wasn't such a measure,
I think it would have been very difficult

189
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,420
to create a culture that
accepts differences

190
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,590
Not just the participants

191
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,290
but those who are planning PyCon Korea
should all be respected

192
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,860
I believe the CoC is essential for that

193
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,920
I think I should also personally
make an effort to make that happen

194
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,520
but if we all observe the CoC and each
make an effort to be considerate of others

195
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,680
I think that will create a better
conference and a better society

196
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,200
Thank you

197
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,810
Yes, to me, CoC

198
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,600
is the reason I became interested
in diversity for the first time

199
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,680
So, to me, CoC is

200
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,200
like a friend who reminds me
about the importance of diversity

201
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,920
and helps me and everyone
to grow in our daily lives

202
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,690
Honestly, if I only thought about
my own experiences and opinions,

203
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,520
I would probably be stuck there

204
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,880
If diverse people gather,
diverse thoughts come together

205
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,040
and my own thoughts become
refined in that gathering

206
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,000
That would allow me to grow more

207
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,960
and make me become a better person

208
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,610
That's why I hope that with the CoC

209
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,350
we can all have a valuable
experience in which we can grow

210
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,060
To me, CoC is the very heart of

211
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,310
our slogan this year, 'We Are Pythonistas'

212
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,180
I encountered the CoC
for the first time at PyCon

213
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,900
When I saw the CoC being emphasized
in various locations of the event

214
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,190
I realized that it was an event that truly
embraces every person and every Pythonistas

215
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,380
It really hit home for me

216
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,290
As a participant and even as
a volunteer in the Organizing Team

217
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,830
I probably didn't observe the CoC perfectly

218
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,230
but by continuously checking on the CoC

219
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,710
I hope this will become an event that
embraces everyone as a Pythonista

220
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,000
To all of you who are watching right now,

221
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,400
thank you for joining us at the festival

222
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,400
We are Pythonistas
