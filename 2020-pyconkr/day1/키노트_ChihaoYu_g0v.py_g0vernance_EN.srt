1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,720
Hi everyone, this session is titled,
"g0v.py g0vernance.txt".

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,640
My name is Chihhao Yu

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,820
and I'm from Taiwan.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm a g0v contributor.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,410
First of all, these slides
are publicly available on the Internet,

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,740
so if you go to the URL here,

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,240
you can just see
the slides for yourself.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,220
These slides are also open source,

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,240
it's released under a CC license.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Here are a list of contributors.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,620
And before we begin,
there's a warning

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,200
that says personal perspectives
do not represent g0v as a whole.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,160
I'll explain more later,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,840
but because g0v is a community,
not an organization,

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,680
so, everyone stands for themselves,

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,240
everyone speaks for themselves.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,540
Let me introduce
a little bit about g0v,

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,020
which is the name of our community.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,320
g0v is spelled, G-Zero-V.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,220
The name came from
the word, "Government"

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,020
G-O-V, but replaced
the O with a zero,

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,220
meaning either start over,

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,760
start from zero,
or digitization of government.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,460
This is a Taiwanese movement
started from 2012.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,740
And it has been very active
until now, actually.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,460
The g0v community has a manifesto

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,460
and it describes what
it is in the document.

28
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,600
So, I'll try to adapt from the g0v manifesto
and summarize it for you,

29
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,360
and tell you what g0v
is in my own perspective.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,900
So, g0v is a polycentric
community in Taiwan

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,220
that uses open-source technology

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,020
and open collaboration to
better government and society.

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:15,370
Every slide would have sources
that links to the sources,

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,100
the references that's used in a slide.

35
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,540
So, here you can see

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
a Mandarin version
of the manifesto,

37
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,250
and also an English version
of the manifesto linked in the slides.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,700
So, what this means is g0v is a community
that has a lot of centers.

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,700
These centers include projects
or task forces.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
And each of these centers,

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
these projects, these task forces,

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,320
will decide what they want to do
for themselves.

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,940
And each one of these centers
would collaborate together.

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,920
And g0v's main methods are

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,380
using open-source technology
and open collaboration,

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,090
and the goal is to
better government and society.

47
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,960
So, today, since
it's PyCon Korea,

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,690
the organizers have asked me to introduce
some examples of g0v projects

49
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,810
that use Python
in the past and in present.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,500
So, as the title of
this session suggests,

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I'd like to introduce to you

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,160
some g0v projects that used Python.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
So, after a little digging, actually,

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,190
Python was there from the very beginning
of the g0v community.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,960
So, I would like to introduce
to you some a group of projects

56
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,840
that falls under four categories:

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,520
Open government,

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,280
open data, education,
and media literacy.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,360
And, of course, there are many, many
more projects in the g0v community.

60
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,720
But today, because of time,

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,380
there's only so much
we can discuss.

62
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
The first one is actually,

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,300
the first project of the g0v community,

64
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
which is TW Budget,
which stands for

65
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,420
Taiwanese government budget,

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,840
it is one of the first
projects that's produced by g0v-ers,

67
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,010
or which is how we call ourselves
g0v contributors.

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,870
It is a project that visualizes
Taiwan's central government budget.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,750
And since this is a Web version
of the presentation,

70
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,580
I can just go to the Web page

71
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,700
and show you, live,
how this project will work.

72
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,140
As you see,
this is an interactive

73
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,140
visualization of our
central government's budget.

74
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,080
If you click, you can actually
know more detail of each--

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
each of these budget items

76
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,140
corresponding to some government agencies,
big or small.

77
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,150
Because of humor, which is a very
important component of the g0v community,

78
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,290
this Website also converts
every item of the budget into

79
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,680
cups of bubble tea or
slices of chicken,

80
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,170
to sort of represent how much,
how big the budget item is.

81
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,450
The second project that I would like
to talk to you about is a voter guide.

82
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:34,450
Voter's guide is a voter's guide, which
is a list of information

83
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:41,830
of candidates for Taiwan’s both
local and national elections.

84
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,630
Voter's guide is a very old project in the
g0v community.

85
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,910
It started in 2014, I think, if I'm not
remembering--

86
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,080
if I'm remembering correctly.

87
00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:01,320
It has undergone several iterations
and this is the 2020 version.

88
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,870
If you can see, this is a link
to all the legislative candidates here,

89
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,400
grouped by cities or counties
here in Taipei.

90
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,060
You see all the candidates
that was participating in the election

91
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,880
and if you click into them,
you see some of their information,

92
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,280
including which of the
legislations they've supported

93
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,640
including how much
Facebook ads they have--

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
they have put out on Facebook.

95
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,980
And then we have projects for open data.

96
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,460
The first one, this one, is also very old.

97
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,020
It's ER Dashboard.

98
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,020
ER stands for emergency rooms.

99
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,220
This is a dashboard of all
the emergency rooms in Taiwan, showing

100
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,460
how many patients are
in each of these rooms

101
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,280
and how many beds are available,
for example.

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,180
This one, this project, Rentea
is a newer project in the g0v community.

103
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,220
It is about rental housing info in Taiwan.

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,250
And all of these projects use
Python in various ways,

105
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,860
including in front-end, back-end

106
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,290
but most of them use Python
for data processing.

107
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,010
This one is pronounced 'Moh-wet dict'.
MoE Dict.

108
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,520
This is a dictionary, an open-source
dictionary that is also a very old project

109
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,000
in Tai-- sorry, in the g0v community.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,360
And this is a combination of a lot of
different government and academic sources

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,530
to combine into one open-sourced dictionary
online for people to use.

112
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,320
And if you see here, this is
the MoE Dict Website.

113
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,080
This is a term that says, "The best"--
or "The brightest."

114
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,440
And this is the Mandarin version
of the phrase

115
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
and these are the Taiwanese version,

116
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,460
the English version,
even French and German.

117
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,120
And because this-- because this
is open source, it also

118
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,120
allows people to collectively correct it,
if there is any mistake.

119
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,440
Another project is iTaigi,

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
which, in Taiwanese,
means 'love Taiwanese'.

121
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,280
Taiwanese is our local language here.

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,400
Quite different from Mandarin,
which is sort of a standardized language.

123
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,210
This is-- this is a website
for you to learn

124
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,800
different pronunciations
of Taiwanese terms.

125
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,240
You can actually listen to the
pronunciation on the Website.

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,980
It also has-- it also has
interesting features,

127
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,120
like how to pronounce your name
or how to pronounce Pokemon monsters.

128
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,520
And that was an educational project,

129
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
and the final category
I want to talk about

130
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,040
is a media literacy project.

131
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,000
This one is called News Diff.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,920
As the name suggests, this project--
records or archives news articles,

133
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,620
but also detects changes over time.

134
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
This is the website of the project.

135
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,100
You see, each item is a news article,

136
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,660
and the system automatically detects

137
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,860
the first-- the first instance
of the article when it's published,

138
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,360
but also subsequent changes
in the article,

139
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,220
both in the title or in the content.

140
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,050
So, it's very useful
if you want to do further analysis

141
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,310
on news coverage here in Taiwan.

142
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Another project I want
to talk to you about is Cofacts.

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,060
Cofacts is a crowd-sourced,
fact-checking platform and a line bot.

144
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,860
What this means is that it's
a line bot, as in people can send

145
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,020
suspicious information to
Cofacts database.

146
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,740
It's a crowd-sourced,
fact-checking platform,

147
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,580
as in people can collectively
come together

148
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,580
and fact check those messages together,

149
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,100
and publish the results
into Cofacts’ database,

150
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,520
so that the original user who submitted
the message will receive them.

151
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,220
This is Cofacts' Website.

152
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,180
And you can see how it works.

153
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,900
You forward suspicious information
to the line bot

154
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,720
and then if the database contains it,
you will receive fact-checking results.

155
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
If the database doesn't have it,

156
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,200
then you can also join
the fact-checking efforts.

157
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,200
Another project is Oarchive.
This is very new in the g0v community.

158
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,640
This is an effort to archive
not only just the news websites,

159
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,440
but all kinds of different
information here in Taiwan,

160
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,760
including some of the more
suspicious ones like content farms,

161
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,160
but also Taiwan's local Web forums,
like PTT or dcard.

162
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,400
These-- these media literacy projects
all have open data, which means

163
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,440
it's very useful to
researchers and academics

164
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
who want to do this kind of research.

165
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,320
So, there are a lot of
projects in g0v community.

166
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,370
And why are there so many projects?

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,100
A big component of the g0v projects--
sorry, the g0v community is food.

168
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,800
The g0v community hosts hack-a-thons

169
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,320
every now and then, and every hack-a-thon

170
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,100
would have a lot of pizza,
a lot of fried chicken,

171
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,920
a lot of drinks, and also desserts.

172
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
And sometimes, these foods are themed
to make it more interesting.

173
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
So, these events and this food--

174
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,940
these foods is a very important component
that supports the entire community,

175
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,700
and what you might
call infrastructure of the community.

176
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,960
And-- we just saw many projects
in g0v community

177
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,640
that's using Python to do
all sorts of things

178
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,500
like open data, like media literacy.

179
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,100
But you can also use Python to build up
infrastructure of a community.

180
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,010
So, I'd like to talk to you about this.

181
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Two major functions of infrastructure
in a community:

182
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,820
One is to connect
and the other one is to discover.

183
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,720
Because the g0v community is such
a polycentric, or decentralized,

184
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,060
or distributed community,

185
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,920
and there is a lot of different things
and different places

186
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,630
that you might not know
about as a g0v contributor,

187
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,700
or as an outsider who wants
to know more about g0v.

188
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,260
So, important features of infrastructure is

189
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,160
to connect a lot of different projects,
and different people,

190
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,160
maybe into one place,
maybe into a GitHub repo.

191
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,360
So you can see a list of all kinds
of things that happen in the g0v community.

192
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,960
Another important function
of the infrastructure

193
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,440
is to discover, is for you to--
discover things that you're interested in,

194
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,620
in the community, despite its--
decentralized nature.

195
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,960
So, for example, you can use Python
and people have used--

196
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,540
g0v contributors have used Python
to, for example, collect information

197
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,240
on GitHub repos, or GitHub issues.

198
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,860
But people have also used Python
to build a search interface

199
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,410
for all kinds of things g0v related.

200
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,720
This is the search interface on g0v's
official Website.

201
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,060
If you search, for example, COVID,
you will see a lot of different things.

202
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,520
This page is full of chat log

203
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,960
and there's more chat log.

204
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,400
And there's more chat log.

205
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
So, this is an example of using Python

206
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,520
to build up infrastructure
for the community.

207
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,580
So, I think infrastructure for g0v
is also infrastructure for polycentrism,

208
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:56,920
which is infrastructure to support
this kind of distributed community.

209
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,060
There are a lot of times when people ask,
"Why is g0v decentralized?"

210
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,740
Or, "Why is g0v polycentric?"

211
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,900
It's a very important question,
and a very interesting one.

212
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Everyone has their own opinion,

213
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,180
and everyone has their own perspective
when answering this question.

214
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:22,900
What I think is why is g0v polycentric
is because democracy is also polycentric.

215
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,900
In a democracy, like South Korea
or Taiwan,

216
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,340
there are a lot
of different kinds of people,

217
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,900
and people have all kinds
of different opinions.

218
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,900
And people form different groups,
different organizations,

219
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,220
different networks, and every different
networks or different groups

220
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,620
does different things, and because we
have basic freedoms, civic liberties,

221
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,780
we're doing
what we want to do,

222
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,780
and we have the freedom to associate,

223
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,860
we have the freedom to assemble,
and we have the freedom of speech.

224
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,420
And these kind of values, these values

225
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,960
are the values that
the g0v community supports.

226
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,880
So, what I think is g0v

227
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,530
could be seen as a mini version.
or a shadow version of

228
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,640
the larger democracy or
society that we live in today.

229
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,660
And g0v is also a very good place to
discuss or even experiment

230
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,280
different kinds of democratic methods.

231
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,330
So a community like g0v
is very decentralized or polycentric,

232
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,920
which also means that
it needs policies and mechanisms

233
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,640
to protect
or to support its polycentrism.

234
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:51,060
I think a community like g0v
needs policies and mechanisms

235
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,220
to maintain its polycentric nature

236
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,880
to prevent abuse--
to express its many selves

237
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,360
meaning everyone is
everyone is a g0v contributor.

238
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,950
And everyone sort of reflects different
characteristics of the community.

239
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The community also needs
policies and mechanisms to grow

240
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,900
and to evolve into
whatever the contributor wants it to go.

241
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,420
So, these kind of policies and mechanisms

242
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,280
could also be seen
as a part of infrastructure.

243
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,200
And although it's not Python,
it's not written in Python,

244
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
it's still kind of a code.

245
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,460
Maybe it's policies, general concepts,

246
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,500
also maybe it's just
very concrete rules that

247
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,100
defines how things are done,
and what other things are not allowed.

248
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,460
This is why the second part of the title
of this session is, "g0vernance.txt".

249
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Although g0vernance is not
actual runnable code

250
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,760
the computer might not know it,
but people certainly know how to read,

251
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,100
and how to set up, and how to challenge
these kinds of code.

252
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,300
So, I'd like to talk to you about these kinds
of code as a second part of this session.

253
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Like the part before,

254
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,620
I’ve also identified some different
categories when it comes to g0vernance.

255
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,620
Different projects,

256
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,300
some of these projects here
in the g0v community is related to policy.

257
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Some of it is actually
establishing mechanisms for

258
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,680
how things work and
what kind of things are not allowed.

259
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,600
The other kind of project
is to create maps, which means

260
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,320
since g0v is such a big and diverse
community, we need maps to navigate.

261
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,700
We need maps to understand
sort of the whole picture,

262
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,840
or as close to the whole picture as
we could possibly be.

263
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,040
And the final category is 0RG.

264
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
This is a play on the organization.

265
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,040
But it's not a top-down
or a hierarchical organization,

266
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,800
as we usually are familiar.

267
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,380
This is an organization that
has g0v’s characteristics,

268
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,680
but also doing concrete actions to sort
of implement the policies and mechanisms,

269
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,120
and try to evolve
and make them better as well.

270
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,140
From the very beginning of the community,

271
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,140
you see a lot of shared
documents that talk about these things.

272
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,580
Here are three examples of early
g0v documents that talk about g0vernance,

273
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,420
in a very philosophical,
but also sometimes very concrete ways.

274
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,460
There are three topics:

275
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,040
Citizenship, media policy,
and foreign policy.

276
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
If you just look at foreign policy,

277
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,380
it almost feels like g0v is a
kind of government,

278
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,340
which--actually, was part of the idea
when g0v community was first started--

279
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,140
is to create some kind
of shadow government

280
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,140
in order to supervise the government,
and to better the government,

281
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,180
to show a different
working kind of prototype,

282
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,660
to show that we can govern ourselves

283
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,660
differently, and more efficiently,
and more inclusively.

284
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,440
The first document that we have
is regarding citizenship.

285
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,940
And it talks about how
to talk about yourself as a g0v-er.

286
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,320
In Mandarin, there's different-- different
kinds of terms to describe yourself,

287
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,160
as someone who is connected,
or who is participating,

288
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
or who is contributing to the community.

289
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,080
And here is the actual document
that talks about this.

290
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,600
It actually--
it actually just lists out

291
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,820
different kinds of way to
identify yourself as someone

292
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:15,200
who is connected or who--
who acknowledges the community.

293
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,740
This first one is contributor,
the second one is participant.

294
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,960
And then different kinds of ways
to talk about yourself,

295
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,940
and also lists out the pros and cons
of different ways to identify yourself.

296
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,720
For example, if you say that you are
a member of the g0v community,

297
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
the pros are--

298
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
it's easily understandable
for other people,

299
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
and it creates less confusion
for other people.

300
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,320
But the cons are--

301
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,600
because g0v is a polycentric community
that has very vague borders,

302
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
but the term 'member'

303
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
just suggests that some people are inside,
some people are outside,

304
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,800
but it's actually
more complicated than that.

305
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,900
The second document is media policy.

306
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Media policy talks about how g0v-ers
go on the media and talk about g0v.

307
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,820
Here is the content of the document.

308
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,260
And it has many suggestions
on what to do and what not to do.

309
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,780
This is the document for foreign policy.

310
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,780
It actually just expands
media policy and talks about

311
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,100
how g0v-ers engage with--
sort of, the world.

312
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,900
Things are-- things that are not communal.

313
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Other hierarchical organizations.

314
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,440
Or other people that have not heard
of g0v and how do we engage with them.

315
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,240
It lists out different ways
of engaging with the world.

316
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,840
This one is a panel discussion.

317
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Maybe a press conference.

318
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
How do you-- how do you--

319
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,840
what is the best way to sort of
navigate those situations.

320
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,680
And here is when you are
the point of contact

321
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
how do you do that?

322
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,700
This is when you're invited to
give a talk, how do you do that?

323
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
And--

324
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,700
Yeah. It’s very interesting to
read these early documents to

325
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,800
look at how early on g0v contributors
think about these issues.

326
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,740
And these issues also
persists in the community.

327
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
People still think about them

328
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,740
and all kinds of different mechanisms

329
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,200
are still being evolved, or being changed
as we speak.

330
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,580
There's two examples here

331
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,860
I'd like to provide that actually set up
concrete mechanisms for g0vernance.

332
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:13,060
The first one is the amendments,
or how to amend the g0v communi--

333
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Sorry, the g0v manifesto.

334
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Remember the-- one of the first
ideas we talked about in the g0v manifesto

335
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,540
is how g0v describes itself.

336
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,140
So what happens if g0v
evolves and the description

337
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,460
when it was founded no longer fits
the current situation?

338
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,640
It's sort of like, how do we
amend our constitution when--

339
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,220
things have changed, when time has passed,

340
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,320
when the situation
is very different from before.

341
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,920
So, in October 20th, 2019
some g0v-ers actually came up

342
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,260
with a procedure of how to amend
our manifesto.

343
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,220
The central idea is that anyone
can propose an amendment to the manifesto.

344
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,260
And there are also
some conditions regarding

345
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,660
how do you propose an amendment.

346
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,700
It has to be proposed
in the big hack-a-thons

347
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,140
that g0v community hosts
every two months.

348
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,140
It has to have a host
of this proposal, meaning that

349
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,140
one person has to be the point of contact
of this proposal.

350
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,420
And it has to have
open documents that anyone can read

351
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,420
about the proposal and
how it's being discussed in--

352
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,620
in the hack-a-thon
and also in follow-up meetings.

353
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
And once the proposal is finalized,

354
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,500
it has to have a public review period
of two weeks.

355
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,360
And it has to the link of the proposal
has to be posted in g0v's Slack

356
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,000
for as many people to see as possible.

357
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And if there's no opposing opinions
in two weeks,

358
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,080
then the proposal is adopted
and it becomes sort of the new manifesto.

359
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,120
And if there are opposing ideas,
or opinions, then we would resolve

360
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,840
to general discussion in the general channel
of g0v's Slack.

361
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,750
So this kind of
procedure is very important

362
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,840
because it lists out exact steps
of the g0vernance.

363
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
It's not vague ideas or
vague, abstract concept.

364
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,840
It's actually-- it's actually
something that you can follow

365
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,650
and go through and, you know,
this is a checklist,

366
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,840
so it's very easy to see where
each of these proposals

367
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,120
is in terms of their progress.

368
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:03,490
So this is actually the final version
that has been proposed on October 20th

369
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,040
and it was passed
two weeks later on November 4th.

370
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,300
It amends the original manifesto
into its current form.

371
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,980
So, this document also provides
some history of the original manifesto

372
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,980
and the changes underneath this.

373
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,980
And a log of all kinds of discussions
that happened during the hack-a-thon

374
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,180
and also during follow-up meetings.

375
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,460
One of the interesting points that
happened during this discussion

376
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,220
is the phrase, 'liquid democracy'.

377
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,260
When g0v was first founded

378
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,260
the idea of liquid democracy actually
excites a lot of people.

379
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,520
And it was in the mani-- it was
put inside the original manifesto.

380
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:04,180
But over time, we realized
the difficulties of the liquid democracy

381
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,380
and in the current form of the manifesto,
this term no longer exists.

382
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,500
The other interesting part is about
freedom of speech, or freedom of expression.

383
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
And there are-- there are talks about

384
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,100
if freedom of expression is
actually the best way,

385
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,620
or the best phrase to describe
what we support fundamentally.

386
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,220
But then, the term actually--

387
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,260
well, after a period of
discussion, the term actually--

388
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
the people have decided
that this term actually

389
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,260
is still the best way to
describe what we think here,

390
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:48,760
so it was put--
it was kept unchanged.

391
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,760
So, this is a very good example
for me to see,

392
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:02,190
while g0v has fundamental ideas as foundations
or infrastructure as the community,

393
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,080
it's also very adaptable
and it's also very open

394
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,780
and transparent when people
when people propose change.

395
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,960
Open discussions are facilitated
and different ideas are considered.

396
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:29,360
This sort of for me, in a way,
manifests g0v's own beliefs in itself,

397
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,410
which is very interesting
and very good to me, I think.

398
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,980
The second example is
how the g0v community

399
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,080
governs its social media platforms.

400
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
And as you might know,
g0v has a official--

401
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,660
Facebook account, Facebook page, actually.

402
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,360
So, the question,
the concrete question is

403
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,880
who gets to post what
on g0v's Facebook page?

404
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:08,060
So, this has been very vague
for some time.

405
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,260
And some time last year,
some g0v-ers, including myself,

406
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,260
decided to come together
and discuss if we can set up

407
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,200
a concrete checklist-style mechanism

408
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:29,050
for all g0v contributors to follow

409
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,200
and while not make
the g0v Facebook page

410
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,100
the tool for a minority of
the g0v contributor,

411
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,740
but actually anyone can propose a post
to be posted.

412
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,840
So, this is the final mechanism
that was discussed and decided.

413
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,840
And we have decided that
there will be a group of reviewers

414
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,080
that reviews every post that's been
proposed to be posted.

415
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
And fundamentally, what's important

416
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,040
is that all the proposals
and all the discussions

417
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
has to take place
in public spaces.

418
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,500
In public channels on Slack,

419
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,740
or in public shared documents
like Google Docs or HackMD,

420
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,040
so that it remains transparent.

421
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,940
We have also decided--

422
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,860
The g0vernance mechanism or model
of the reviewer group--

423
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Who gets to be a reviewer?

424
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:42,400
Anyone can say that he or she
or they want to be a reviewer.

425
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,020
And if two people agree, they can join
the reviewer group and become a reviewer.

426
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,180
We have also discussed the review period,

427
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:05,240
meaning how long does a post
have to be reviewed before it's posted?

428
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,760
So, this is a very concrete and

429
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,620
and something that could be practiced
in reality.

430
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:22,820
And this mechanism has actually been
heavily enforced

431
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,820
during the past couple of months

432
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,820
because right now, the g0v community

433
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,180
is preparing for its summit
at the end of this year

434
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,380
and because of the promotional
needs of the summit,

435
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:43,740
there were a lot of posts being proposed
to the reviewers to be posted,

436
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
And the workload spiked

437
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,540
and produced a lot of workload
for the reviewers.

438
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,940
And that was a challenge
for this mechanism.

439
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,970
And perhaps there will be a discussion of
how to make it more efficient in the future.

440
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,050
But the important thing is--
the important thing is all this--

441
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,260
all these discussions are transparent
and open to anyone to see and participate.

442
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:18,460
So, that it doesn't become
closed off and abused by some people,

443
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
rather the other.

444
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
So, let's go back to the slides.

445
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,260
The other type of project is map.

446
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,260
This is a very difficult
kind of project to do

447
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,980
because g0v is so diverse and
is so decentralized.

448
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,740
No one actually knows how big it is.

449
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,740
For example, we know that on
g0v's Slack, there are

450
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
more or less eight thousand accounts.

451
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,040
But we never know the exact number of
people who would identify

452
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
as g0v-ers, for example.

453
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,560
And we have never known the exact numbers
of projects that's in the g0v community.

454
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,320
That's why people have done things like

455
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,560
aggregating repo info,
or aggregating issue info.

456
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,560
People have done multiple project hubs
to try to aggregate all--

457
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,080
all the projects
of the g0v community, but

458
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,720
it was a very difficult project to do.

459
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
And so is the map.

460
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:30,460
This is something I attempted
less than two years ago, in 2018.

461
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,460
I was trying to think of
different projects that I know

462
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,100
in the g0v community and try to
create a map of how they overlap.

463
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,900
And this map was created.

464
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,900
It was very chaotic.

465
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,810
It's quite difficult to read,
so this is a very early draft

466
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,900
of what a map could look like.

467
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,500
And because g0v is decentralized,
everyone could create their own maps.

468
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,600
And maybe there's a way
to collectivize these results

469
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,470
and create a more inclusive map
from different perspectives.

470
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,600
And the final example that I want
to share with you is organizations,

471
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,600
or groups, or task forces,
as we call them,

472
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,240
that practice these
g0vernance models or mechanisms.

473
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,460
There are more than one of these groups,

474
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,700
but the one I have been participating
is called g0v International.

475
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,660
This is a fairly new task force--

476
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,820
that was established
in the end of 2018.

477
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,300
Sorry, the end of 2019.

478
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:52,780
What we were concerning was the g0vernance
Of g0v's international affairs.

479
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,360
Since g0v was founded in 2012,

480
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,360
because there were a lot of projects

481
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,640
alot of contributors of the g0v movement

482
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
people from outside Taiwan

483
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,640
started to notice the
community and started to reach out,

484
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,440
and trying to establish
different kinds of relationships.

485
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,440
g0v-ers were invited to give talks,

486
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,440
g0v-ers were invited to collaborate
with outside organizations outside Taiwan.

487
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Some other chances are people want
to fund certain g0v projects

488
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,960
these all kinds of
international exchanges or affairs

489
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:39,010
really touches the center of what we
just talked about g0vernance of a community.

490
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,960
At its core, I think, it's the question:
who gets to represent the community

491
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,860
when reaching out to the
international community?

492
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,360
So, g0v International is a new task force
that's established

493
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,960
to think about this problem

494
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,960
because there are a lot of different
problems that we think of every day,

495
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,160
but if there's no
people inside the project

496
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,160
to think of it constantly,
there will not be progress.

497
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,160
So, because I think
about g0vernance a lot,

498
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,040
so I participated
in this task force to think of

499
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,300
to think about this problem together
with other g0v-ers.

500
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,860
And one thing that we
feel strongly is that

501
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:34,660
rather than doing international
exchanges through conferences,

502
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,120
by giving talks,
giving keynote addresses,

503
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,720
what we think might be a better way to do
these exchanges is

504
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,640
to host hack-a-thons,
international hack-a-thons,

505
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,000
so that it's not so much
as one g0v-er on the stage

506
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,820
representing the entire community,

507
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,820
but it's more about inviting
more than one.

508
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,820
many g0v-er contributors to
come to the event,

509
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,820
and also inviting a lot more
different members

510
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,840
or contributors of different communities
from the international-- from the world

511
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,000
to come together in a hack-a-thon
and actually talk about projects,

512
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,360
and actually work together on projects.

513
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:26,140
So, this is one thing that the g0v
international task force think would--

514
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:33,860
would more or less alleviate
or lessen the impact of one person

515
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,020
representing the community,

516
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,900
because there are times
when this is necessary--

517
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,080
when talking to
groups or organizations

518
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,100
that doesn't necessarily know what
a polycentric community is.

519
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,040
So, what the g0v International has done
in the past two years is host such events.

520
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,680
The g0v International task force
hosted two hack-a-thons,

521
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,920
along with our partners or our friends
in Japan,

522
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,680
in South Korea, and in Hong Kong.

523
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,440
The first event
was hosted in Okinawa, actually.

524
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,280
We were joking that Okinawa
is sort of the midway between

525
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,280
all these places that we have--
we are collaborating.

526
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,280
It's actually not, but everyone
gets to fly somewhere else,

527
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,860
which is really interesting and attractive
to a lot of us.

528
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,440
We are calling these hack-a-thons
"Facing the Ocean" meet and hacks.

529
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,200
Facing the Ocean is something that we’ve
talked about and discussed together,

530
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,410
between contributors in Taiwan
in Japan, in South Korea, in Hong Kong,

531
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:55,300
and thinking about
Facing the Ocean,

532
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,300
finding different opportunities
to network together.

533
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:07,300
And the first one is, as I just said,
it was hosted in Okinawa in June 2019,

534
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,300
and the second one was hosted
in Tainan here in Taiwan,

535
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,300
a southern city of Taiwan,
in December 2019.

536
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,560
And we were scheduling the third one
to be hosted in Jeju Island, South Korea,

537
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,060
this summer, but because of
COVID-19 we're not allowed,

538
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,060
we're not able to do that,

539
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,620
so instead, we've been hosting
online sessions, small or big

540
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:40,420
trying to keep this network alive,
and exchanges our experiences

541
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,140
in all kinds of things, including how to
fight this pandemic together.

542
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,340
So, in close,
I'd like to share this thought with you

543
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,680
is although there are a lot
of different projects in g0v,

544
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,640
I think my favorite g0v project
is g0v itself.

545
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,380
It's being to see all this diversity,
all its differences,

546
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,780
but also trying to find commonalities

547
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,280
between different projects,
different people.

548
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:21,840
And thinking about g0vernance might be
really dull for some people, but not to me.

549
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,670
I think about these rules,
these mechanisms a lot,

550
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,720
and these, I think, really is important

551
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,680
to a community that wants
to keep its polycentric nature and

552
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,840
wants to keep it open, wants
to keep things transparent.

553
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:47,470
So, that's why I decided to accept
the invitation of the organizing team and

554
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,330
come to you and share not only the history
of some projects of the g0v community,

555
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,840
but also g0vernance and how
g0v-ers are handling

556
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,840
this very different and complex
issue together.

557
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,840
So, there is a very common saying
in the g0v community,

558
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
which is, "You are nobody."

559
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,840
This comes from a wordplay
in the Mandarin language,

560
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,740
is that nobody-- we often complain,
"Why is nobody doing this?"

561
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:31,770
But one belief that's very central to
the community is that you are that nobody.

562
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,920
If you see something that nobody's doing,

563
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,700
maybe you're the one
who's supposed to do that.

564
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,810
So in close, I'd like to share this
saying with you,

565
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,900
that all of you are nobody.

566
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,660
Which means that if you see something
that you want in the world,

567
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,660
you are the one to make it happen
and exist in the world

568
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,560
not only just using technology,

569
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,260
not only creating open data,
but other things as well.

570
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,170
People often say that
people often ask,

571
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,570
"If I don't know how to code,

572
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,920
can I participate?
Can I join the community?"

573
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,120
And people always say, "Yes."

574
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
You don't need to know coding.

575
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,280
You don't need to be an engineer
to contribute to the g0v community,

576
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,180
or any other kind of community

577
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,060
that's using technology and collaboration
to better government and society.

578
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,600
In g0v, there are a lot of people
who are designers, who are writers,

579
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,600
who are lawyers,
who just doesn't know how to code,

580
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,820
doesn't know how to
write a computer program.

581
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
But everyone knows--

582
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,820
but the important thing is

583
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,820
keep the spirit of
open source in your heart

584
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,820
and collaborate in an open manner.

585
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,760
And that way, the community
will thrive and grow with you.

586
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,440
So, here are three links
if you are interested to follow.

587
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,420
One is including
this slides, a lot of these-- I mean,

588
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,240
most of g0v's shared documents live
in this Web service called HackMD.

589
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,040
This is a link for you to check out

590
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,240
all the different kind of documents
that's been composed by g0v-ers.

591
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,120
The second link is for you
to join g0v's Slack.

592
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,270
If you are interested,
come into our chat room and talk to us.

593
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,120
And the third link is actually
if you're even more interested

594
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,120
you are very welcome to
come join us at the end of this year,

595
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,120
December 3rd through
December the 6th,

596
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:58,320
the g0v Summit 2020, which is
g0v community's biannual gathering.

597
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,900
This year, because of COVID-19,
foreigners might not be able

598
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,640
to attend physically here in Taiwan,
but we are working very hard

599
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,160
to design mechanisms
for people to participate remotely,

600
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,780
including our speakers
and regular participants, attendees.

601
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,080
And this year's g0v Summit

602
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:32,230
the temporary, or the working theme
is locality and connectivity,

603
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,640
which means that
there are a lot of communities

604
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
here in Taiwan, not just g0v,

605
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,680
and there are a lot of
different communities in our region

606
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,640
in Taiwan, in Japan,
in South Korea, in Hong Kong,

607
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,300
and other places here in Asia,
and also across the world.

608
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,880
So, we want to explore
what more can we do when we're connected?

609
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,120
What more can we do when these networks

610
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,160
are built, are maintained,
and are nurtured?

611
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,310
So as one of the co-chairs
of this year's g0v Summit,

612
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,880
I very sincerely invite
and welcome you to come

613
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,080
in December to join us
in g0v Summit 2020.

614
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,380
So, that's my session.

615
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,380
Thank you for listening.

616
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,380
If you have any questions,

617
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,380
come to g0v's Slack and
I'll be there,

618
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:35,080
and as will be many more
g0v contributors to--

619
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,080
to answer your questions,

620
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,560
to introduce you to different projects,

621
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,700
and yeah, just to talk.

622
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,700
Thank you very much.
