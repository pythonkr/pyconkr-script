00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,100
Hello

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,990
"PyCon Korea's 7-year History
We're Also Newbies to an Online PyCon"

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,620
I am Yeoneui Hong from the PyCon Korea
Organizing Team and I'll be presenting today

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,980
PyCon first started in 2014

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,940
and this is the 7th year
that it is being held

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,380
This is a picture from 2014

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,850
2015

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,430
2016

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,300
2017

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,780
2018, which is when I joined
the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,860
And 2019

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,940
And the anticipated year of 2020

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,100
Actually, we had an exciting first meeting
in mid-February this year

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,740
with our new members of
the PyCon Korea Organizing Team

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,370
It was mid-February, and we were really
worried about gathering at the time

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,050
so for those who wanted
to participate virtually

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,140
we provided a separate
video conference link

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,540
However

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,350
we later ran into
an unprecedented situation

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,700
and the 2020 PyCon Korea Organizing Team
never gathered as a whole

21
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,030
I think we did maybe once

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,780
We had to meet virtually online

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,010
and since we had to change how we will hold
the event, we began to discuss it

24
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,420
I will share with you what
discussions we had in order to

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,340
turn PyCon Korea 2020
into an online event

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,890
To help you better understand,
I will explain to you on how

27
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,430
the 2020 PyCon Korea Organizing Team works

28
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,380
First of all,
we don't have a representative

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,100
Since we don't have
someone representing us

30
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,300
we did everything by discussing
and making agreements

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,980
We had a lot of discussions

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,460
Nothing happens based on
a single person's authority

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,100
We all make an agreement to do something
and share the responsibility

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Instead, since everyone
has different experiences

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,020
we discuss based on those experiences

36
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,340
and we also work together with
the thought that we are all equal

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,100
However, I bet some of you are
watching this and wondering

38
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,140
how we can work and make decisions
by having so many discussions

39
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,700
You could think that way

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,640
In order to make up for this

41
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,780
we have introduced and are using a tool
called the 'gradients of agreement scale'

42
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,260
I will briefly explain what this is

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,640
This is what it is

44
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,900
If you take a look, this is how we
can be a little more efficient

45
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,860
while listening to a little bit of
what everyone has to say

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,780
You choose from the gradients of agreement
scale that ranges from one to eight

47
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,140
and before we start our discussion

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,120
we vote on a gradient of agreement
that ranges from one to eight

49
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,980
If you look, there's
whole-hearted endorsement

50
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,700
and eight is 'veto'

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,060
which is where you reject a proposal
so much that you'd block it

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,500
Since we voted in the very beginning

53
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,100
we discuss after the voting

54
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,260
and then vote again after the discussion

55
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,060
This is how we mediate opinions

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,900
On March 11, we had our first discussion

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
on how to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,240
Honestly, at the time,
we were all so confused

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,160
that we didn't even know
what we should discuss about

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,230
So we had a meeting on March 11

61
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,390
to decide on what we should discuss about

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,840
Here on the screen is an excerpt
from our minutes from March 11

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,700
Since we had previously put
together what to discuss about

64
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,940
on March 15, we discussed what
options we had to choose from

65
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,860
As you can see from the flow chart,
"Should the PyCon be held or not?"

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,180
"Should the event be held
offline or virtually?"

67
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,900
"Should the event still
be held in August or not?"

68
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,260
Since we have always held the event at COEX

69
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,140
"Should the event be held at COEX or not?"

70
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,100
We came up with these options

71
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,730
So on March 18, based on
the choices we had drawn

72
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,280
we discussed using the
gradient of agreement scale

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,240
As you can see, this is an extract
from our minutes from March 18

74
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,860
Whole-hearted endorsement,
agreement with a minor point of contention

75
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,600
We've covered them up right now,
but we wrote down every opinion here

76
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,120
We even had people who vetoed

77
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,580
and everyone's opinions varied

78
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:27,260
Because everyone's opinions were so
diverse, we couldn't come to a conclusion

79
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,530
Since we had each expressed our initial
level of agreement on March 18

80
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,500
and also held a discussion

81
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,190
we conducted a preliminary
survey the following week

82
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,230
using the gradient
of agreement scale

83
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,500
This is the survey that
we conducted internally

84
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,290
And a week later on March 25

85
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,820
we held a meeting with the tremendous title
'The Concluding Meeting and Vote Regarding

86
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,110
Holding PyCon Korea 2020
and Measures for COVID-19'

87
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,760
We held a discussion based on
the preliminary survey results

88
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:09,200
On March 25, through a virtual meeting

89
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,190
we held a final vote on
our level of agreement

90
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,940
And finally

91
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,750
we landed on this conclusion

92
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,460
As you previously saw on the flow chart,
Choice 1 was

93
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,820
Should the PyCon be held?

94
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,060
Yes, the event will be
held in whatever format

95
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,300
Second, should the event be held offline?

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,840
No, let's hold it virtually

97
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,190
Should we still hold it in August?

98
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,560
Actually, just discussing about
Choices 1 and 2 took up a lot of time

99
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,700
so we couldn't finish talking about
Choice 3 during this meeting

100
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,980
Although the conclusion was somewhat made

101
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,460
we still had to decide on
the date of the event

102
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
We held this meeting on April 1

103
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,820
As you can see, there were various opinions
to hold it in mid-September,

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,970
on the last week of September,
that October was too late

105
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,780
Finally, on April 3,
many of you probably saw this

106
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,060
We announced on PyCon's social media
that the event will be held online

107
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,190
As you can see from
our process of discussion

108
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,260
we went through numerous discussions
to announce these four sentences to you

109
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,620
It definitely wasn't an easy process

110
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,780
Even afterward, our PyCon Korea Organizing Team

111
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,130
continuously held discussions to
decide how to hold a virtual PyCon

112
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,860
how many days and hours it will be held

113
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,480
how the sessions will be streamed

114
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,050
whether the event should
be free or not and so forth

115
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,400
To mediate our opinions,
we researched

116
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,980
and based on this, we decided one by
one how the event would be held

117
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,760
The good thing was that we weren't
the only ones preparing a virtual event

118
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,500
We connected with PyCon organizers overseas
who were preparing their events virtually

119
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,340
We shared documents regarding
switching to a virtual event

120
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,220
and held meetings with
the members of PyCon APAC

121
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,340
We were able to have such experiences

122
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,540
Some people commented that we were able
to connect with PyCon organizers overseas

123
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,340
even more than before

124
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,660
But everything didn't go so smoothly

125
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,060
As a preparation for our event

126
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,960
we sign a provisional contract for
the COEX Grand Ballroom a year in advance

127
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,480
However, we couldn't help but
cancel the provisional contract

128
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,530
that we had signed back in 2019

129
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,290
because the event was
going to be held virtually

130
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,940
Since we were preparing for our first
ever virtual PyCon, we were always talking

131
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:55,420
but even up to that point, the sense of
closeness was relatively weaker

132
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,720
than when we worked
together in person offline

133
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,700
Personally, after making
the announcement on April 3

134
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:12,620
I went through what seemed like the Dark
Age of our preparation from April to June

135
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,770
Finally, June came

136
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,280
and our preparation went into full swing

137
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,130
If you are following our PyCon Facebook
account, you probably saw this photo

138
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,540
It had been a while since the PyCon Korea
 had all gathered virtually

139
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,380
so we set up a Zoom virtual background
that said 'We are Pythonistas'

140
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,540
and took a group photo after the meeting

141
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,670
This is the PyCon Korea
PyCon Korea Organizing Team's shared calendar

142
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,020
The meetings were spread out in July

143
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,400
but it was packed in August

144
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,740
Honestly, August simply zipped by

145
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,410
And now, it's September is ongoing

146
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,990
That's because this video was recorded

147
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,800
before the event at which
you are watching this

148
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,990
Now, I'd like to share with you
about what has changed

149
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,580
ever since PyCon Korea 2020 became virtual

150
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,020
One of the goals we had while
preparing for the PyCon Korea 2020

151
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,980
was to share our experience of
having been together even in 2020

152
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,500
to those virtually participating
in the PyCon Korea

153
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,780
In order to do that,
we prepared this session

154
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,760
so that we can share with you
what kind of things we considered

155
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,220
and what kind of work we did

156
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,480
Other than PyCon, there are
probably many other communities

157
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,740
that are preparing to
hold their events virtually

158
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,180
We hope we can be helpful to them as well

159
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,020
First is the registration process

160
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,050
With PyCon's tradition of 'Everybody Pays'

161
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,780
participants, presenters, and even the
PyCon Korea Organizing Team members

162
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,940
all purchased tickets

163
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,330
However, our event was free of charge this
time so there was no need to get tickets

164
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,660
since we were going to stream
the event via YouTube Live

165
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,500
Still, we created a process for ticket
purchase just the same as before

166
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,090
We did it because we wanted to invite
our participants to a virtual space

167
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,650
but the biggest reason was that
we wanted to give you the feeling

168
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,540
of having registered to this year's PyCon

169
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,330
So to all participants who registered
for this year's PyCon Korea regardless

170
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,120
thank you very much

171
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,620
Second is changes regarding the sessions

172
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:52,580
Up until now, all presentations were
held at the COEX Grand Ballroom

173
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,340
At PyCon Korea 2020, we have
recorded all presentations in advance

174
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,460
and streaming it on YouTube
like you are watching right now

175
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,300
If the presentations were
streamed online in real-time

176
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,150
there could be issues such as
poor connection or quality

177
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:14,580
so we avoided that and also captioned
the videos in advance so that everyone

178
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,460
could participate in this event regardless
of their hearing or watching environment

179
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,870
The Keynote sessions in English
were translated in advance

180
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,160
to lower the language barrier

181
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,270
We even recorded the opening
and closing videos in advance

182
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,230
which personally made my heart ache a bit

183
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,540
since there's something special about
opening and closing an event

184
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,580
but that couldn't be helped

185
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,500
Anyway, recording 40 videos total
that were each 25~40 minutes long

186
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,900
and checking them wasn't
an easy process at all

187
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,610
We recorded the presentations

188
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,040
from mid-August to end of August

189
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,460
At first, the presenters had the
option to record at a studio

190
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,200
You could record at a studio
or using Zoom

191
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,340
or record your presentation on your own

192
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,890
We were going to start recording mid-August

193
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,340
but things got very serious then

194
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,340
and we canceled recording at a studio

195
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,860
and many presenters used Zoom
to record their presentations

196
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,660
At this time, two members from
the Organizing Team and one presenter

197
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,660
met on Zoom and recorded the presentation

198
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,420
Of course, we had created and distributed
a video recording guideline for presenters

199
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,090
and I think we might reveal
the guideline later on

200
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,030
While we went through
40 presentation videos

201
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,260
we checked to make sure that
every video observed the CoC

202
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,700
After all the videos were recorded,
we edited them to be streamed

203
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,780
and then captioned

204
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,390
After the captioning was done

205
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,240
we checked to see if there were
any errors in the technical terms

206
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,090
After going through this process,
the presentation videos for

207
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,110
the PyCon Korea 2020 that you've seen
for the past two days were ready

208
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,060
We thank all the presenters
who have made time to share

209
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:29,260
their valuable experiences to
contribute to the Python ecosystem

210
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,050
Next is track management

211
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,100
The PyCon usually consists of five tracks

212
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,200
For example, we had split
the COEX Grand Ballroom

213
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,690
into five sections numbered 101~105

214
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,940
However, during the virtual PyCon,
we had to stream 40 session videos

215
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,500
via YouTube Live over
the course of two days

216
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,020
so we split them into tracks
like we always used to

217
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,520
If you look at the track names

218
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,660
although, honestly, I'm not sure
how this will change later on

219
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,620
but the names are
101, 102, 103, 104, and 105

220
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,760
We named them in remembrance of COEX

221
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,060
Someone posted this on Twitter,
and I asked for permission to show it here

222
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,210
"I heard that PyCon Korea
will be held virtually"

223
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:27,010
"Are they going to overlap the tracks
and session times like they do offline?"

224
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,180
That actually happened

225
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,260
I hope everyone enjoyed the experience

226
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,940
Next is that the Pythonistas' meeting point

227
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,460
changed from the COEX
Grand Ballroom to Slack

228
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,380
We made the decision to offer Slack

229
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,180
to those who bought tickets in advance
or to individual sponsors

230
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,370
We grouped the Slack channels by
categories from the PyCon sessions

231
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,710
so that the participants could
have discussions more easily

232
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:05,190
For those of you watching this video
and will be preparing for another event

233
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,560
if you are registered as
a non-profit organization

234
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,380
you can use Slack at a discounted price

235
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,790
We used Slack during the event
at a discounted price for

236
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,060
non-profit organizations

237
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,960
Next is a very important
value of PyCon Korea

238
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,180
which is the CoC, the Code of Conduct

239
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,390
Of course the existing CoC
did contain content regarding

240
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,510
situations happening online

241
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,860
However, it didn't apply for an event
that was only held virtually

242
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,140
so we supplemented this part

243
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,860
For more details about the CoC

244
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,780
there was a special session yesterday
by the Python Korea Organizing Team

245
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,470
called 'Expanding the world one more step'

246
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,380
so please check out that video
for more information

247
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,590
Next is the merchandise

248
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,700
Actually, we were sad to let this part go
due to the event becoming virtual

249
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,590
At PyCon, there is an event
called 'Bag Insert'

250
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,140
for the presenters, members of the
PyCon Korea Organizing Team, or anyone

251
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,510
Everyone would gather before the event
where there are 1,800 or so eco bags

252
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,900
to fill with merchandised goods

253
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,610
However, since that wasn't
possible this time

254
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,140
we had no choice but to
use a delivery service

255
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,540
We used Tumblbug

256
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,100
to sell T-shirts, which can't be
left out at a developer event

257
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,080
and also to receive
donation from individuals

258
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,160
Instead, we prepared merchandised
goods so that you could receive them

259
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,660
before September 26, the date of the PyCon

260
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,340
The T-shirt manufacturer did
the individual delivery

261
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,890
and even combined shipping
for gifts and merchandise

262
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,770
designated for individual sponsors

263
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,420
so it was very nice

264
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,220
I'd like to take this time to express our
greatest gratitude to our sponsors

265
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,300
who contributed to the
PyCon in different ways

266
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,210
Next are the sponsoring companies

267
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,690
Because PyCon became a virtual event

268
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,450
we had to change the benefits
provided to the sponsors

269
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,150
to befit an virtual environment

270
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,710
Also, the sponsors' booths that used to be
set up in front of the Grand Ballroom

271
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,690
were changed to virtual booths

272
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,760
For those of you watching this video,
we'd greatly appreciate it

273
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,500
if you visit our sponsors' virtual
booths at the PyCon website

274
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,320
Despite the event becoming virtual

275
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,020
we thank our sponsors for greatly
contributing to running PyCon

276
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,300
This was our first-ever virtual PyCon Korea

277
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,420
so in order to focus on
running this event smoothly

278
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,840
we had to cancel our other programs
inevitably such as tutorials, sprints,

279
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,050
childcare service, and young coders

280
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,870
We hope that we will
someday have the expertise

281
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,100
to run these programs virtually as well

282
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,260
However, we just couldn't
give up the lightning talks

283
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,230
We used to receive presentation materials
online on a first-come-first-served basis

284
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,700
and then have the presentation
at the site of the event

285
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,460
This year, we received recorded videos
on a first-come-first-served basis

286
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,590
and then streamed them online

287
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,100
Also, we made a hashtag
event on social media

288
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,380
In the past, we merely shared that
we had a hashtag for our event

289
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,860
This year, we utilized hashtags
to hold small events

290
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,660
Actually, I'm talking in past tense but
for me right now, this is a future event

291
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,180
because as I mentioned before,
this video is being recorded in advance

292
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,730
The main reason to have a hashtag
event was because of our group picture

293
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,670
If we had held PyCon at an offline site

294
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,230
we probably would have taken a photo
holding a banner at the end of the event

295
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,910
However, since that's not
possible this year

296
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,740
we're trying to collect your photos
for a group photo

297
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,100
If you are watching this video
on September 26 and 27

298
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,780
you will participate in the
hashtag event, won't you?

299
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,660
I will wish from the past that in the
future, I would have put together

300
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,660
a wonderful group photo with all of you

301
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,370
So I've shared what kind of struggles
and steps we went through

302
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,580
to hold our first virtual PyCon Korea

303
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,090
Honestly, I thought preparing for
a virtual event would be easier

304
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,580
However, it wasn't easy at all

305
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,660
I know we weren't perfect in some areas
but what I hope is that

306
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,550
you remember that PyCon
Korea took place in 2020

307
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,820
and how much fun it was for you

308
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,380
Lastly

309
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,440
From February until September 25 of 2020,
our PyCon Korea Organizing Team

310
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,540
prepared for PyCon Korea 2020

311
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,820
entirely online

312
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,260
Slack, Slack, Slack, Dooray!, Dooray!,
Dooray!, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom

313
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:27,620
Since we could only meet virtually,
we really, really wanted to meet each other

314
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,380
And to really wrap things up

315
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,140
for the final two months before the event
and even way before that

316
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,650
we spent more time together
via Slack, Zoom, and Dooray!

317
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,620
even more than with our families

318
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,670
When one team finished its dawn shift,
the morning team came

319
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,660
and then the evening team
would take over after work

320
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,540
It was really tough, but we always
tried to support each other

321
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,700
To our beloved members of the
2020 PyCon Korea Organizing Team

322
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,820
I'd like to say thank you to all of you
as I finish this session

323
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,740
Thank you
